# HMC_basics
Simple codes making use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling.

hmc_alm_Cl.ipynb: infers signal spherical harmonic coefficients and their power spectrum given data = signal + noise. Uses a toy power spectrum Cl, everything in harmonic space. Gaussian noise. No beam. No mask. To do: implement beam smoothing, treatement of mask (i.e. real space computation).
